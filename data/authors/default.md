We are one of the hottest and fastest growing Talent Groups in Vietnam. We're looking to change the game for our Vietnamese, VK and Foreign talents to positively use their star status in the Industry. We are deeply invested in Vietnamese talent aiming to grow their brand to the next level while also giving back to their roots - the communities that they are a part of.

In addition to talent management, we organize events and provide venue concept consulting and wealth management services. We are a group of entrepreneurs, artists, entertainers and athletes that values trust, transparency, loyalty and family relationships above all else.
